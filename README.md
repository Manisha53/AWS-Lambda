# AWS-Lambda
An object or file organizer project based on date using AWS lambda - A Python execution

Weâ€™re going to write our Python script that will create a folder in the S3 bucket we created. The folder will be named based on the day we create the folder. Afterwards, our Python script will also move all the files that someone uploads into our S3 bucket in the folder based on the day the file was uploaded.
